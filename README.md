## Building

Building the book from the Markdown sources requires
[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Once installed, `mdbook build`
will build the static HTML files in the `book/` directory, whilst `mdbook
serve` will build and serve them at `http://localhost:3000`. Please refer to
the mdBook documentation for futher options.
